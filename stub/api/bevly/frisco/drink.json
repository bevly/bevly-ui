We conduct this dry hopping not once but twice, in two separate tanks. Then, at packaging, to ensue a vigorous secondary fermentation and natural carbonation, we krauesen Suruga Bay with a percentage of peak fermentation beer from a different batch. Suruga Bay Imperial IPA is a wickedly compelling flavor experience. Its hop character is as rich as Japan\u2019s Suruga Bay is deep (it is Japan\u2019s deepest bay and Baird Brewing is located on its inner shore).

Don't worry, we're getting there. With the aid of Simcoe, Centennial, and Chinook hops we give one hell of an India Pale Ale. A super citrusy bouquet leads to the first sip an eruption of sharp, zesty bitterness. You want an IPA? Here's your IPA.",

            "friscoDescription": "The Berliner Weisse is a very interesting style. A beer that is essentially brewed as your typical wheat beer, then spiked with lactic acid. This gives the beer an intense, pungent, acidic tartness that is often too extreme for most drinkers. In fact, in Germany most Berliner Weisse-biers are served with a shot of fruit syrup to balance out the aggressive sourness. We created this brew by doing a 48 hour sour mash, allowing the \"sourness\" to develop naturally. Then, we dry hop the living hell out of this beer with Galaxy hops, a hop varietal that's commonly found in a lot of Imperial IPAs, to add more of that acidic/sour/tartness to the beer. Natural blood orange juice is then added to bring a wholesome fruit tartness. Lastly, we pitch a tiny bit of lactic acid to vamp up the sourness even further. With all this said, everything is done within reason to stay within the boundaries of creating a beer that drinks like blood orange juice. The end result is refreshingly tart, pleasantly crisp, rich in orange citrus, and low in alcohol so you can knock a few of these back with ease. Drink up, it's hot as shit outside.",

Replacing Victory\u2019s Hop Wallop\u00ae Ale, which will take a hiatus from the market for the time being, DirtWolf Double IPA will launch the brewery\u2019s entry into four-packs when it begins to hit markets in October\". \u201cSo a wolf and a prospector walked into a bar\u2026,\u201d joked President and Brewmaster, Bill Covaleski. \u201cNo, in all seriousness, Hop Wallop will be missed, but isn\u2019t necessarily gone forever. We developed that brand 10 years ago as our flavorful response to the hop-bomb vogue of the time. But as brewers who enjoy experimenting with beer styles and ingredient varieties, we looked for the opportunity to do other interesting recipes as time passed. Making the decision to put Hop Wallop aside for a few years allows us to bring this delicious new double IPA, DirtWolf, to the market in bottles.Darkly heroic, Humulus Lupulus (hops) have empowered brews with bite and character since the 11th century. DirtWolf is a tribute to these untamed vines which rise from the earth with the voracity of a \u2019wolf among sheep.\u2019 Hops have made an assertive comeback in American craft brewing. Revel in the best US varieties of hops, in their natural, whole flower form, as they bring a vital, pungent reality to the soul of a wild element in our dangerously satisfying DirtWolf.
